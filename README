Sample program showing how to use Raygui with custom render library.

This program using tigr as graphics library. 

I did not able to use standalone Raygui with macro RAYGUI_STANDALONE. This is 
why I wrote fake "raylib.h" header with some raylib macros, typedefs and 
function's declarations needed by Raygui.
